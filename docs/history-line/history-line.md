## Purpose in Thought Experiment 思想实验

Imagine a scenario where a million modern humans include you are teleported to Earth 30,000 years ago. As a leader that everyone obeys, you must develop modern technology from hunter-gatherer life as quickly as possible. However, only You are allowed to carry only one thing - a document when teleporting, which will record what you need to develop technological civilization with the minimized information redundancy since you can only bring limited files. And such a document is the purpose of this project.

Again，Small and Useful Document: <br/>   1. Serve as Quick Developing Guide <br/>2. With Minimized Redundancy.

请想象这样一个场景，有一百万现代人包括你会被传送到3万年前的地球。作为人们绝对服从的领袖，你需要带领人们以最快的速度从狩猎采集生活恢复出现代科技文明。然而传送时，你们其中只有你被允许携带唯一物品即一份文件。由于受到物理大小限制，这份文件应当以最小的信息量，最有效的方式来记录你所需要的信息。那么总结出这样一份文件即为本项目的目的。

重复一遍，一份尽可能小而有效的文件：<br/>1. 有效-作为快速发展的向导 <br/> 2. 小-尽可能少的信息冗余
