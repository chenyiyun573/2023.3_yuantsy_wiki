# Basic Philosophy Assumptions
{: .no_toc }

## 1. Why I study Philosophy of science

The development of theoretical physics has greatly exceeded the common thinking and concepts in our daily lives, and the objective reality image of matter is lost. Here we have used a lot of mathematical logic inference to create a lot of “pure” logical concepts and sometimes we are caught in a parametric game with a large number of complex equations. With the further elimination of "metaphysical prejudice", physics becomes more and more out of intuition, The following randomness, subjective and objective, virtual and real, consciousness and matter are the problems that human beings are destined to face to establish a world picture. We have to return to our own thinking logic itself and reflect on the correctness of this scientific reasoning process. (Written by ChenYiyun in 2021)


## 2. 科学在于做出正确的陈述 

科学从不强加人们任何事物，它只是陈述。科学的目的在于对客观事物做出正确恰当的陈述。[1]

1. 科学理论是可证伪的
科学所研究的对象是可观察的对象，不论是自然现象还是社会现象，提出科学的理论需要对现象进行观察，根据现象总结规律，通常是作普遍性的描述。当我们可以找出与理论相悖的观测证据时，该科学理论则被否定。[i]

2. 科学理论以语言为载体
科学是可被人们所理解的，哲学多使用抽象化的自然语言来解释说明，而物理学常常使用数学语言来描述现象。

3. 科学是客观的
每个人的认知主体都是自己，我们通过感官到语言建立起对世界的理解。当我们讨论科学时，我们假定所有人观测到的现象都是具有同等效力的。我们试图把自身特殊的认知主体排除在世界图景外，以获得客观正确的描述。[ii]

4. 简化和统一
我们尝试用，相对简单的，相同的理论体系去解释现象。我们尝试用更少的假设来解释更多的现象。为了解释单一现象去架构很多复杂的概念是不明智的。[2]

5. 现代西方科学的历史基础
西方科学的发展是以两项伟大成就为基础的：古希腊哲学家发明的形式逻辑体系（在欧几里德几何学）和（文艺复兴时期）发现通过系统性实验有可能找到因果关系。[3]
(Edited by ChenYiyun in 2021)

[1] 薛定谔在《生命是什么》中提到过这一点
[2] 类似奥卡姆剃刀法则
[3] 爱因斯坦给斯威策的回信中提到
[i] 关于可证伪性。“科学理论都是可证伪的”，这样的表述并不足够严谨，因为经验观察本身常常也要依赖于一定的理论预设，比如天文观测依赖于光学理论，当某一次观测的结果与某一理论矛盾时，我们可能无法判断是理论本身还是观测所依赖的理论基础有问题。

[ii] “科学是客观的”这一表述并不严谨。这里会有很多哲学问题存在，比如如何界定主客观，当当我们摒弃了个人感官和意识在世界的位置，颜色声音，冷热从何而来呢？我们会发现世界生动的图景必须要感官的介入才得以被描述。

## 2. Science aims at Making True Statements
Science never imposes anything, science states. Science aims at nothing but making true and adequate statements about its object.[1]
1. Scientific theories are falsifiable
The object of scientific research is an observable object, whether it is a natural phenomenon or social phenomenon. Proposing scientific theories requires observing the phenomenon, summarizing the law according to the phenomenon, and usually making a general description. When we can find observational evidence that contradicts the theory, the scientific theory is denied.[i]
2. Scientific theories use language as the carrier
Science can be understood by human-beings. Philosophy often uses abstract natural language to explain things, while physics often uses mathematical language to describe phenomena.
3. Science is objective
Each person's cognitive subject is himself, and we build an understanding of the world through our senses and language. When we discuss science, we assume that all phenomena observed by all people are equally valid. We try to exclude our own special cognitive subject from the world picture in order to obtain an objective and correct description.[ii]


 


4. Simplify and unify
We try to explain the phenomenon with a relatively simple, same theoretical system. We try to explain more phenomena with fewer assumptions. It is unwise to construct many complex concepts in order to explain a single phenomenon.[2]
5. The historical basis of modern Western science
The development of Western science is based on two great achievements: the formal logic system (in Euclidean geometry) invented by ancient Greek philosophers and (the Renaissance) that it is possible to find causality through systematic experiments.[3]


[1] Schrodinger mentioned it in his book What is Life
[2] Similar to Occam's Razor Law
[3] Einstein's reply letter to J.S. Switzer


[i] Regarding falsification. "Scientific theories are all falsifiable." This statement is not rigorous enough, because empirical observations themselves often also rely on certain theoretical presuppositions. For example, astronomical observations rely on optical theory. When the result of a certain observation contradicts a certain theory, we may not be able to judge whether there is a problem with the theory itself or the theoretical basis on which the observation depends.
[ii] "Science is objective" is not rigorous. There will be many philosophical issues here, such as how to define subjective and objective. When we abandon the position of our personal senses and consciousness in the world, where does color sound come from? We will discover that the vivid picture of the world requires sensory intervention.


## 3. 感官和经验 Senses and memory

### 定义感受野 Define the receptive field
作为人类我们有视觉，听觉，味觉，触觉，温觉，痛觉，以及由其他感受器输入造成的感觉。这些感觉上的初始输入的总和，我在这里定义为感受野。


感受野的内容是不需要学习过程的，不存在理解与不理解的问题，只有能否感受到的问题。当我们感受到温度时，当我们看到某物的颜色时，我们的感受器在向大脑输入信号，这并不需要任何的学习，一个新生的婴儿和完整经过高等教育的人没有任何区别。
感受野内的信息是最基本的单元，即不可以相互之间解释说明，比如我们无法向一个天生失明的人用以听觉话语为载体的语言描绘不同的颜色是怎样的。我们无法向聋人描述音乐。我们无法抽离感受器去定义感觉，比如用其他感受比如视觉和听觉来让他人感受到什么是痛觉，什么是冷热。
人类的信息输入必须通过感受野，我们没有感受野信息以外的知识，我们构造出来的任何概念，理解任何东西都建立在感受野信息输入的基础上。我们无法想象感觉之外的任何东西。


As human beings, we have vision, hearing, taste, touch, temperature, pain, and other sensory input. The sum of these initial sensory inputs, I define here as the receptive field. 
The content of the receptive field does not require a learning process. There is no question of understanding or incomprehension, only the question of whether it can be felt. When we feel the temperature, when we see the color of something, our receptors are inputting signals to the brain. This does not require any learning. A newborn baby is no different from a person with a complete higher education. 
The information in the receptive field is the most basic unit, that is, it cannot be explained to each other. For example, we cannot describe music to the deaf. We can’t separate the receptors to define sensations, such as using vision and hearing to make others feel pain, cold and heat. 


### 记忆形成 Memory formation
感受野的信息输入在时间上的积累形成了记忆和经验。
The accumulation of information input from the receptive field over time forms memory and experience.

## 4. 语言 Language
Written by 陈熠云 in 2021

### 自然语言的载体 Carrier of natural language
主要是以声音和图像符号作为载体，我们约定不同的声音和图像符号有着特定的意义。

Mainly based on sound and image symbols as the carrier, we agreed that different sound and image symbols have specific meanings.


### 对于从未进行语言学习的人来说 For people who have never studied language
一个声音并没有其他的含义，一个图像符号并没有其他的含义。或者对于人们听到或见到从未学习过的语言时，我们没有办法从其中获取对语素的听觉和对符号的视觉之外的信息。
A sound has no other meaning, and an image symbol has no other meaning. Or when people hear or see a language that has never been learned, we have no way to obtain information other than the auditory sense of morphemes and the visual sense of symbols.


### 开始初步地学习语言 Start to learn the language
当我们使用一个单词指代一个对象时，我们把相应的符号或声音与该对象联系在了一起。这是我们人类学习的一种机制。当下一次我们再面对具象的对象或抽象的语言词汇时，这一做链接的记忆会被唤醒，我们通过这种方式赋予抽象语素以具象的意义。
When we use a word to refer to an object, we associate the corresponding symbol or sound with the object. This is a mechanism by which we humans learn. The next time we face concrete objects or abstract language vocabulary, this memory of linking will be awakened. In this way, we give abstract morphemes concrete meaning.

### 更复杂的语言 More complex language
一些高度抽象的词汇，我们无法找到静态的客体来与之对应。但是，一方面，记忆和神经认知模式的增多使得我们抽象出很多动态的，特征性的，不具体的概念。另一方面，我们仍然可以用链接记忆的方式，多接触这些抽象词汇的不同使用场景和语境来感受其含义的微妙特点。
For some highly abstract words, we cannot find static objects to correspond to them. However, on the one hand, the increase in memory and neurocognitive models has allowed us to abstract many dynamic, characteristic, and non-specific concepts. On the other hand, we can still use the way of linking memory and get more exposure to the different usage scenarios and contexts of these abstract words to feel the subtle characteristics of their meanings. 

### 数学语言 Mathematical language
相比于自然语言，数学语言聚焦于数量关系，同时数学语言更加精炼准确，没有二义性。各种代数，函数分析，微积分，方程，用于准确清晰地描述数量关系。
Compared with natural language, mathematical language focuses on quantitative relationships, while mathematical language is more refined and accurate, without ambiguity. Various algebra, function analysis, calculus, equations are used to describe quantitative relationships accurately and clearly. 

 

### 计算机语言 Computer Languages
目前的计算机建立在数字电路的基础上，以高低电平的排列来表示离散关系。数字集成电路可以用于描述时序，逻辑，离散数量关系。
The current computer is built on the basis of digital circuits and expresses the discrete relationship with the arrangement of high and low levels. Digital integrated circuits can be used to describe timing, logic, and discrete quantitative relationships.

### 警惕过度抽象的概念 Be wary of overly abstract concepts
过度的抽象使得一些语素难以传达准确有效的信息。过度的抽象而没有感受野的具象解释使得一些话语退化成为了符号本身，而不传递明确的信息，无法消除不确定性。
Excessive abstraction makes it difficult for some morphemes to convey accurate and effective information. Excessive abstraction without concrete interpretation of the receptive field makes some discourses degenerate into symbols themselves, without conveying clear information, and unable to eliminate uncertainty.

## 5. 真实与命题 Truth and proposition
Written by 陈熠云 in 2021

### 对命题判断的分类 Classification of propositional judgments
如何判断一个命题是否为真？命题，即可以判断真假的陈述句。作为一种陈述，我个人把命题分为两种。

1. 基于对当下感受野输入的观测信息进行判断。这一陈述就是对感官输入信息的描述，当对当下的输入信息描述符合我们感受到的内容时，我们声称该命题为真，比如眼见为实。命题要么为真，要么为假，在对当前时刻下现实世界的描述里，此时此刻的观测是没有二义性的。此时的陈述要么符合观测内容，要么不符合。

2. 基于一定的逻辑系统和预设为真的公理系统。比如数学体系中的逻辑判断，物理体系中的逻辑判断。这些体系都建立在一些公理，定律上，这些公理定律往往都是全称命题。如果命题所描述的情况包含在这些公理定律中，那么命题符合此体系，即为正确。在物理体系中，如果我们观测到的不符合物理体系的现象描述，那么我们就需要对原有的理论体系做出修正。

How to judge whether a proposition is true? Propositions are declarative sentences that can be judged true and false. As a kind of statement, I personally divide the proposition into two kinds.

1. Judge based on the observation information input to the current receptive field. This statement is a description of sensory input information. When the current input information description matches what we feel, we claim that the proposition is true, such as seeing is believing. The proposition is either true or false. In the description of the real world at the current moment, there is no ambiguity in the observations at this moment. The statement at this time either conforms to the observation content or does not conform.

2. Based on a certain logical system and an axiom system that is preset to be true. For example, the logical judgment in the mathematical system, the logical judgment in the physical system. These systems are based on some axioms and laws, and these axioms and laws are often universal propositions. If the situation described by the proposition is included in these axioms and laws, then the proposition conforms to this system and is correct. In the physical system, if the phenomenon we observe does not conform to the description of the physical system, then we need to modify the original theoretical system.

### 反思真实 Reflection on truth
所有的命题式描述都是建立在感受野输入与记忆上的陈述句。现实世界没有二义性，现实发生的事件有且只有一种情况。而命题可以指称多种不同的情况，因此有了符合与不符合的真假判断。换言之，真假的判断的存在是因为，我们大脑能想象的情况有很多，而现实生活只有一种情况，呈现在当下的现实世界是唯一的。

命题的真伪判断是一种基于集合论所属关系的逻辑判断。命题一陈述，就提供了某些信息，限定了范围，我们判断一个元素属不属于框架体系所规定正确的部分，或者符不符合我们观测到的结果。是一种所属关系。对于全称命题的证明和特称命题的证伪，我们往往需要遍历所有情况。

关于真实，我们所谓的真实永远只是相对的。比如说历史，或者说遥远地方的新闻报导，我们难以进行信息的甄别，但又不能走入历史虚无主义的误区，只好选择相信的同时保持一定的批判和怀疑。我们不能感知他人真实的情绪和体会，只能通过他人的表情和陈述做推测，这显然带有猜测的成分。我们关于过去的回忆可能会随着新信息的涌入被篡改，并不能保证其绝对的正确。我们可能唯一确定的真实是关于当下的感觉输入，尽管也有类似缸中之脑的假说来质疑这种输入，但我们也只能凭此去定义真实了，这种过度的叠加的怀疑是无穷无尽的。

All propositional descriptions are declarative sentences based on the input and memory of the receptive field. There is no ambiguity in the real world, and there is only one case for events that happen in the reality. And propositions can refer to many different situations, so there are true and false judgements of conformity and nonconformity. In other words, the existence of true and false judgements is because there are many situations that our brains can imagine, but there is only one situation in real life, which is unique in the current real world.

The true or false judgement of a proposition is a logical judgement based on the belonging relationship of set theory. As soon as the proposition is stated, it provides certain information and limits the scope. We judge whether an element belongs to the correct part of the framework system, or whether conform to the results we have observed. It is a kind of affiliation. For the proof of universal propositions and the falsification of special propositions, we often need to traverse all situations.

Regarding truth, what we call truth is always relative. For example, in history, or news reports in distant places, it is difficult for us to screen out real information, however, we cannot walk into the misunderstanding of historical nihilism. We must choose to believe while maintaining a certain degree of criticism and suspicion. We cannot perceive the real emotions and experiences of others and can only make speculations through the expressions and statements of others, which obviously contains guesswork. Our memories of the past may be tampered with the influx of new information, and there is no guarantee that it is absolutely correct. The only truth we may be certain about is the current sensory input. Although there are hypotheses similar to the brain in tanks to question this input, we can only rely on this to define the truth. This excessively superimposed doubt is endless.


## 6. 什么是数学 What is mathematics
Written by 陈熠云

数学是一种关系或者联系。我们不关心集合里元素究竟是什么，这依赖于感官，在数学上，我们关心的是集合和元素之间的关系，不同运算导致的关系。对于数字，抽象于物质世界，我们在数学上关心的是数与数之间的一种关系。在几何上，我们极少讲点是什么，直线是什么，平面是什么，我们研究的是点，线，面之间在不同情况下的各种关系。个人在思考时感受到，我们建立的数学体系，很难去再对比较基本的定义，公理上做进一步的批判性思考，因为这来源于直观的感官，直观经验难以再进一步做任何解释。而研究数学，和解数学题，更多是在逻辑上理清楚这些关系，联系，我们从底层直观构造出更复杂的数学式以描述更复杂的关系，这些表述在现实生活中有着不同应用，但是仍然是一种关系。计算机及其编程体系可以很好地表述一些离散的关系。我们可以用计算机表示很多关系，使用高低电平的变化和结构，产生时序，逻辑，算数，去描述这些关系，这是数学的一种自动化形式。

Mathematics is a relationship or connection. We don't care what the elements in the set are. This depends on the senses. In mathematics, we care about the relationship between the set and the elements, and the relationship caused by different operations. For numbers, abstract from the material world, what we care about in mathematics is a relationship between numbers and numbers. In terms of geometry, we rarely talk about what a point is, what a straight line is, and what a plane is. What we study are the various relationships between points, lines, and surfaces in different situations. When I think about it, I feel that it is difficult for the mathematical system we have established to make further critical thinking on the more basic definitions and axioms, because this comes from intuitive senses, and it is difficult for intuitive experience to give any further explanation. In studying mathematics and resolving mathematical problems, more is to clarify these relationships and connections logically. We intuitively construct more complex mathematical formulas from the bottom to describe more complex relationships. These expressions have different applications in real life, but Still a relationship. Computers and their programming systems can express some discrete relationships well. We can use computers to express many relationships, using changes and structures of high and low levels to generate timing, logic, and arithmetic to describe these relationships. This is an automated form of mathematics.

## 7. 因果 Cause and effect
Written by 陈熠云

数学，物理体系是人为构造出来的，其基本的公理往往是全称命题，即广泛普遍地规定了所有的情况。在给定的条件下所陈述特殊条件，用三段论推出一个特殊的结果，这样的因果推论，个人感觉，并没有特别的因果性（一个是因一个是果，一个推导出另一个的因果关系），因为公理定理是全称的，其实所有的可能情况都描述清楚了，一个特殊情况自然也应该符合该描述。这更像是集合论，一个全集包含着子情况，是一种全称到特例的关系，而没有因果的承接顺序，不过在我们进行推出时，有从A到B的这样一个过程，常常就这样说因为A所以B。

在现实世界里的A到B的这样一个看似因果的过程，休谟的怀疑论质疑了这种因果关系。确实，个人也觉得这种做归纳法的因果关系像科学定律一样不能证明，但有反例就能证伪。

我们把顺序发生的两件事加上了因果关系，是我们的一种思维形式。个人认为，我们加上因果关系，是先构造了一个理型世界应有的秩序，再三段论推断，预测结果，这种思维同上一段的内容是一种预设全集推出特例的方式，更类似于集合论的关系描述而不存在因果。

我想，这种因果是人思维方式的一个体现，我们能记忆过去发生的事情，能在一时刻调用联想与之相关的所有记忆，自然地构造了一个基于经验的有秩序的理型的世界，预测下一步的发生，这一过程，我们称为因果。

Mathematics and physical systems are artificially constructed, and their basic axioms are often universal propositions, which stipulate all situations broadly and universally. A special condition stated under a given condition can be used to deduce a special result with a syllogism. Such a causal inference does not have special causality (one is a cause and one is an effect, and one derives the causality of the other), because of the axioms and the theorem is a universal term. In fact, all possible situations are clearly described, and a special situation should naturally fit the description. This is more like set theory. A complete set contains sub-situations. It is a relationship from universal statement to a special case. There is no order of causality. However, when we deduce, there is such a process from A to B, which is often the case. Say B because of A.

In a seemingly causal process from A to B in the real world, Hume's skepticism questioned this causal relationship. Indeed, individuals also feel that this kind of inductive causality cannot be proved like a scientific law, but it can be falsified if there are counterexamples.

We add causality to two things that happen in sequence, which is a form of our thinking. I personally think that by adding causality, we first construct the order that a rational world should have, and then infer syllogism and predict the result. This kind of thinking is the same as the content of the previous paragraph is a way of presupposing special cases in the complete works, which is more similar to The relationship description of set theory does not have cause and effect.

I think this kind of cause and effect is a manifestation of people’s way of thinking. We can remember what happened in the past, and we can recall all the memories related to it at a moment, thus naturally constructing an orderly and rational world based on experience. Predicting the next step, this process is called causality.
