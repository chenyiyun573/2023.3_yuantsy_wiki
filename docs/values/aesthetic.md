Aesthetic - People Oriented focuses on creating designs and experiences that cater to human needs, emotions, and preferences. This approach emphasizes the importance of understanding the target audience and incorporating their desires and expectations into the design process. By prioritizing people, designers can create products, spaces, and experiences that not only fulfill their functional requirements but also evoke positive emotions, promote well-being, and foster a sense of connection. A people-oriented aesthetic acknowledges the diverse needs and desires of individuals and aims to create inclusive, accessible, and engaging experiences that enhance the quality of life for all.
